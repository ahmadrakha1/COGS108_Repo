You do not have to find every piece of data you will use, but you do need to have demonstrated some idea that (a) this data is gettable and (b) that this data may be different from what your ideal is\n",
    "## Ideal Dataset\n",
    "Ideally, we want to observe the traffic to and from UCSD, with its relationship with weather conditions. If we could have a dataset that logs the exact time a vehicle pull in/out from a parking structure, along with the precise weather condition on campus, that would be perfect.\n",

    "## Potential Datasets\n",
    "Reality is not that nice. Turns out UCSD does not have a weather station itself, and parking data is also hard to excavate without permissions. We have to find alternatives. For weather, we have the weather data from San Diego International Airport, collected by [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). We've proved that this data can be accessed through free ordering, and [here](Weather.csv) is a weather dataset we downloaded.\n",

    "## Difference Between Ideal and Reality\n",
    "After searching and digging, we found out that data excavation is not that easy. For our parking data, it is relatively ****small and sensitive**, which makes it hard to share to public. For Weather data, most of the case you cannot find a weather station **right where you wish it can be**, and you have to use a nearby weather station that is reliable. Data like traffics is also not clean as we expected, because it is nearly impossible to let someone count the number of cars passed by **at the same crossroad**, everyday **continuously for years**."
